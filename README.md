Game jam game

I have never done a program in Monogame before this project. Monica has never done music creation before. Aaron learned about
code structure and how to use monogame more.
After this I feel much more comfortable using the Monogame framework and plan to do some more
projects in monogame using raytracing/raycasting. I feel that the 48hr. Game Jam is idea and definately should be done
in the future.
